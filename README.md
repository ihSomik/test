# GFG 160 – 160 Days of Problem Solving 🚀  
🔗 [Course Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems)

This repo contains my journey through the **GFG 160 Problems** challenge — a daily problem-solving grind that helped me build consistency and problem-solving habits.

## 🧠 What I Learned

GFG has a weird bug — if you just resubmit the same correct code, your total and correct submissions both go up, so your accuracy improves for no reason 😅

I’ve tried solving a bunch of problems in different ways. Even though the course had 160 problems, I ended up doing more than that. Took a bit of extra time, but it taught me to stay consistent, keep trying, and be patient with the process 💪
